# PokemonCardGenerator
A random pokemon card generator
Created using JS, HTML, CSS and LIT-HTML for the front and PokeApi for the back-end !
Every pokemon card is generated using Math.random() of 150 numbers (pokemon ids) and presenting the card after fetching the data from the pokeApi, generating everything including the background dynamically
